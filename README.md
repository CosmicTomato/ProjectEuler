# ProjectEuler

Collected work on many of the problems at https://projecteuler.net/

Coding done in Python Version 3

I haven't been great about listing dependencies, so if something doesn't work without another program...download that one too.

That being said, the majority of these programs are stand-alones, and those that aren't usually rely on a small number of other programs.

Cheers
