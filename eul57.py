#Square root convergents
#It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as an infinite continued fraction.

#âˆš 2 = 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + ... ))) = 1.414213...

#By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:

#1 + 1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5
#1 + 1/(2 + 1/2) = 7/5 = 1.4
#1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2)) = 17/12 = 1.41666...
#1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2))) = 41/29 = 1.41379...

#The next three expansions are 99/70, 239/169, and 577/408, but the eighth expansion, 1393/985, is the first example where the number of digits in the numerator exceeds the number of digits in the denominator.

#In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a numerator with more digits than denominator?
