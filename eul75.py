#Singular integer right triangles

#It turns out that 12 cm is the smallest length of wire that can be bent to form an integer sided right angle triangle in exactly one way, but there are many more examples.

#12 cm: (3,4,5)
#24 cm: (6,8,10)
#30 cm: (5,12,13)
#36 cm: (9,12,15)
#40 cm: (8,15,17)
#48 cm: (12,16,20)

#In contrast, some lengths of wire, like 20 cm, cannot be bent to form an integer sided right angle triangle, and other lengths allow more than one solution to be found; for example, using 120 cm it is possible to form exactly three different integer sided right angle triangles.

#120 cm: (30,40,50), (20,48,52), (24,45,51)

#Given that L is the length of the wire, for how many values of L â‰¤ 1,500,000 can exactly one integer sided right angle triangle be formed?





#problem is based around Pythagorean triples. see wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple
#need to search through all lengths, determine which are equal to the sum of exactly one Pythagorean triple (and not more)
#or: start with primitive Pythagorean triples. find multiples below max length. then delete any duplicates, and finally count the number of entries

		#pulls the triplet out of the list
